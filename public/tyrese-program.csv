Keeping your elbow tucked to your side at 90 degrees, rotate your forearm outward against the band’s resistance. Hold the end range briefly before slowly returning to the start.

"[""Pre-C""]","Bear Wall Hold","Position yourself on all fours facing a wall, with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Lift your knees just off the ground so that they hover an inch or two above the floor – keeping your back flat and core braced. Now press each hand firmly against the wall in front of you while your feet stay planted. Hold this position by actively pressing into the wall with your palms and pushing your heels backwards as if dragging the floor. The goal is full tension across the core, shoulders and hips while maintaining perfect posture. Keep the neck neutral and avoid arching through the lower back. Breathe steadily while holding. If unable to complete without affecting your posture, drop the duration but focus on the technique.","45s","1","'-","'-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"206ecb1e-84fc-49f0-88fc-6be8e85a5387",2025-01-29T03:41:35Z,2025-07-22T20:20:09Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"

Perform short, controlled volleys against the wall using the raised foot. Keep the standing side stable with minimal hip shift or knee collapse. Trunk and ankle should stay firm throughout.

Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width and lift it off the rack, holding it above your chest with arms fully extended. Lower the barbell to your chest in a controlled motion, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle, then press it back up to the starting position.

,"Single-Leg Rudiment Hops","Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart. Engage your core and ensure your posture is upright. Start by hopping forward on one foot, always keeping the other foot off the ground. As you hop, swing one arm forward and one arm back to maintain balance and mimic running mechanics. After completing the hops on one side, switch to your other foot and repeat the same process. Keep in mind, that arms must swing opposite to the hop, mimicking the natural arm swing during running. Aim for a rhythmical, springy hop rather than a high or long jump. Your landing foot should spring off the ground as soon as it touches down, emphasising the reactive strength component. After completing the first set on both sides moving forward, do the same moving left and then moving right. Each time, you should keep minimal ground contact time as the focus, rather than height or distance.","48 (8f, 8,r, 8l, each side)","2","'-","90s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2f9a1ace-a60d-4bb3-8477-21491efefd2b",2025-05-08T15:00:36Z,2025-09-02T17:37:10Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"

Slowly slide the foot out into a lateral lunge, keeping the planted foot still and bending that knee while the slider leg stays straight. At the bottom, push through the planted leg to pull yourself back in, lifting the slider foot off the ground into a single-leg balance. Keep the chest lifted and control both the lunge and return phase.","16 (8 each side)","2","'-","'-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"356c9770-32b4-4772-b114-5a92b264dd1a",2025-01-28T15:59:28Z,2025-06-02T20:52:54Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"
"[""E""]","Fake - Burst - Finish","As the ball rolls, fake the shot and let it continue into your next stride. If the defender is still in front of you, push the ball another 3-yards into space and slightly across the defender, using a stiff arm or leap across to stay in front of them and first to the ball. From there finish on the next touch. You can utilise a toe punt finish if you have little space or time to work with.","2es","2es",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"397c5035-9291-47ef-ae06-40bc011cfa66",2025-01-28T15:59:28Z,2025-07-19T20:23:10Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"
