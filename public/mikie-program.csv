The training is designed to improve quickness when you drive past your man, as well as in powerfully cutting out towards space. There are three weekly sessions split between gym-based and pitch-based work. Session A is an additional daily prehab to stay fit with the regular 90 minutes incoming, while Sessions B and D  focus on acceleration and short-burst speed. Session C is gym-based with a focus on upper power and force production.

"[""C""]","Landmine Split Jerk","Stand with feet shoulder-width apart holding the end of a landmine barbell in one hand at shoulder height. Dip slightly by bending knees and hips, then drive explosively upward, pressing the bar overhead while simultaneously splitting your legs into a lunge position (one foot forward, the other back). Lock the arm overhead and hold briefly, then bring the feet back together and lower the bar under control. Focus on speed, timing, and stability in the split stance.","6 (3 each side)","3","30kg","90s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"e230bc9c-2d29-45ae-8207-6b686cfb3834",2025-01-23T01:42:18Z,2025-09-26T01:45:58Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"

"[""D""]","Sprint from Falling Start","Stand tall and lean forward gradually until your weight forces you to step out to avoid falling. As soon as the first step hits the ground, accelerate explosively into a 10-metre sprint. Keep your body at a strong forward lean through the first strides, driving knees and arms aggressively. Focus on smooth transition from the falling start into full sprint mechanics.","40m (4x10m)","3","'-","Full",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"f6f51d06-f7d3-4884-87d6-6f8bfbe38031",2025-01-23T01:42:18Z,2025-09-26T01:45:58Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"
"[""D""]","Shin Dribbles","Stand tall with a slight forward lean, keeping your core engaged and ankles stiff. Rapidly tap the ground with quick, light contacts, bringing your knees only slightly above shin level. Keep your foot placement directly under your hips, maintaining a fast and controlled rhythm. Avoid excessive vertical movement and ensure a consistent turnover.","20","2","'-","60s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"f86186f3-f68e-4cee-882b-10cace5ae04b",2025-01-23T01:42:18Z,2025-09-26T01:45:58Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"
